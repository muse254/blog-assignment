# Blog Assignment

Using Golang, make a small blog-like application listing articles (Title, author, and content) and displaying article details. It should also have a simple comment system (name, timestamp, and comment).

The sales team would like to know how often people start writing a comment but then end up deleting it. Track this data.

Make sure the app has an API to build a front-end on top of it. Don't worry about the UI itself but instead focus on solving the important problems. Please do implement unit tests.

## Solution

- There's the use of Go's Templating system.
- There's the use of json based storage for simplicity.
- The test db folder is required for the tests to run.
